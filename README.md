# 📊 E-commerce Sales Analysis & Dashboard

## 🎯 Project Goal
This project aims to analyze e-commerce sales data to uncover valuable insights, such as top-selling products, revenue trends, and customer purchasing behavior. Additionally, an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** is built to allow dynamic exploration of the dataset.

## ✅ Outcomes
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Fixed missing values, standardized formats, and calculated total revenue.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified best-selling products, peak sales periods, and revenue distribution.
- **Visualizations:** Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create meaningful charts.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Developed with Streamlit, featuring:
  - **Sales trends over time**
  - **Best-selling products analysis**
  - **Revenue breakdown by category**
  - **Dynamic filtering for product categories**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Streamlit** (for dashboard visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for exploratory data analysis)
- **Excel & OpenPyXL** (for dataset handling)
